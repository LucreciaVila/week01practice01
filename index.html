     <h2>The Taliban have excluded girls from Afghan secondary schools,
          with only boys and male teachers allowed back into classrooms.</h2>

         Schoolgirls told the BBC they were devastated not to be returning.
          "Everything looks very dark," one said.
        </p>
     <p>
         Taliban officials who seized power last month said they were
          working to reach a decision on the matter.
        </p>
     <p>
         Many fear a return of the regime of the 1990s 
         when the Taliban severely restricted girls' and women's rights.
        </p>        
     <p>
         Under their new government, Taliban officials have said that women will be allowed to 
         study and work in accordance with the group's interpretation of 
         Islamic religious law.
        </p>
     <p>
         But <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-58315413">working women have been told to stay 
            at home until the security situation improves</a>, 
            and Taliban fighters have <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-58491747">beaten women 
             protesting</a> against the all-male interim government.
        </p>
     <p>
          On Friday, the Islamist group <a href="https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-58600231">appeared to
          have shut down the women affairs ministry</a>and replaced it with a department that once enforced strict 
          religious doctrines.

     <strong>'I am so worried about my future'</strong>
     <p>
         A statement issued ahead of Afghan schools reopening on Saturday said: 
         "All male teachers and students should attend their educational institutions." 
        </p>
     <p>
         Secondary schools are usually for students aged between 13 and 18, and most are segregated.
        </p>
     <p>
         Taliban spokesman Zabihullah Mujahid was later quoted by Afghanistan's Bakhtar
          News Agency as saying that girls' schools would open soon.
           He said officials were currently working on the "procedure" for this,
            and details including the division of teachers.
        </p>
     <p>
         The spokesman told the BBC that officials were also trying
          to sort out transport for older schoolgirls.
        </p>
     <p>
         Schoolgirls and their parents on Saturday said prospects were bleak.
        </p>
     <p>
         "I am so worried about my future," said one Afghan schoolgirl, who had hoped to be a lawyer.
        </p>
     <p>
         "Everything looks very dark. Every day I wake up and ask myself why I am alive?
          Should I stay at home and wait for someone to knock on the door and ask me to marry him? 
          Is this the purpose of being a woman?"
        </p>
     <p>
         Her father said: "My mother was illiterate, and my father constantly bullied her 
         and called her an idiot.
          "I didn't want my daughter to become like my mum."
        </p>

     <p>
        Another schoolgirl, a 16-year-old from Kabul, said it was a "sorrowful day".
        </p>    
     <p>
         "I wanted to become a doctor! And that dream has vanished.
         I don't think they would let us go back to school.
          Even if they open the high schools again, they don't want women to become educated."
        </p>
     <p>
         Earlier this week, the Taliban announced that women would be allowed to study
         at universities, but they would not be able to do so alongside men
          and would face a new dress code.
        </p>
     <p>
         Some suggested the new rules would exclude women
         from education because the universities do not have
         the resources to provide separate classes.
         </p>
     <p>
         Barring girls from secondary schools would mean none would be able
          to go on to further education.
